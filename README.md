# Support Vector Regression (SVR) using Python

This project implements **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** — an advanced regression technique based on **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**. SVR is particularly effective for handling **non-linear relationships** and **outliers**, offering strong generalization on unseen data.

---

## 🔍 Objective

To explore how SVR uses kernel functions to fit data that is not linearly separable, and compare its performance with traditional regression models.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python**
* **NumPy**, **Pandas** – for data handling and analysis
* **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – for visualizing data and results
* **Scikit-learn** – for implementing SVR and evaluating performance

---

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Exploration** – Import and inspect dataset
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Feature scaling using StandardScaler
3. **Model Training** – Apply SVR with RBF kernel
4. **Prediction** – Predict outcomes on test data
5. **Evaluation** – Measure performance using R² and error metrics
6. **Visualization** – Plot SVR curve and compare predicted vs actual results

---

## 📈 Results

SVR performs well on non-linear datasets, producing a smooth curve that adapts to the data’s distribution. It demonstrates strong prediction capability compared to simple regression models.

## 🚀 Key Learnings

* Understanding the concept of **kernels** in regression
* How **SVR** differs from Linear Regression
* Importance of **feature scaling** in SVM-based models
* Interpreting SVR predictions through visualization
